# UW-Madison-beamer-theme

% ABOUT contains information on contents 

This is a minor hack of an unofficial beamer theme for Hong Kong Polytechnic University whose repository is located at https://github.com/quxiaofeng/PolyU_beamer_theme

This beamer theme now contains University of Wisconsin - Madison logos (currently pertaining to the college of engineering), and minds the official school color scheme guidelines as indicated at http://umark.wisc.edu/brand/web/colors.php . The ad "hack" end product retains the original titling from the sourced beamer theme ("polyu") as it was created swiftly with the goal of just producing something that works given a tight deadline the author had to meet rather than worrying about the source files being indicative of what they are generating.

The modification was permissible as indicated by the author: "This program can be redistributed and/or modified under the terms of the GNU Public License, version 2."

TODO

rework .sty files and folder titlings to be more name representative (UW-Madison) rather than having the polyu name

fork repository with original (I am new to github and figuring things out still)
